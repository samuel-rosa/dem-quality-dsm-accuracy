## Study summary

Digital elevation models (DEM) used in digital soil mapping (DSM) usually are selected based on a priori 
quality criteria that reflect their capacity to represent the landscape surface. The objective of this study 
was assess whether these criteria effectively select the DEM that produces the most accurate DSM. For that 
end, a study case was carried out using nine DEM, their quality being evaluated using quali- and quantitative
criteria. Logistic regression models were calibrated using terrain attributes derived from each DEM to assess
their influence on DSM. Overall, the quality criteria were not efficient in discriminating a single best DEM.
Besides, the quality of the studied DEM was not related to DSM accuracy, thus questioning the common
recommendation of using the best DEM for DSM. Selecting predictor variables contributed more for increasing DSM
accuracy than using finer spatial resolution and more accurate DEM. Identifying the truly best DEM for DSM
requires the a posteriori assessment of DSM accuracy. When this assessment is unfeasible, the safest strategy
might be to use a coarser spatial resolution DEM, e.g. TOPODATA.
